# AI-Powered Course Generation Platform

This repository contains the code for a full-stack application that leverages AI to automatically generate online courses. Users can specify a topic, and the system will create a structured course with multiple lessons, including titles, descriptions, and content.

## Project Overview

The platform consists of two main components:

1.  **Client (Next.js / React):** A web interface for users to interact with the system.
2.  **Server (FastAPI / Python):** A backend API that handles course creation logic, AI agent orchestration, and database interactions.

## Features

### Client-Side:
-   **Course Dashboard:** Displays all available courses.
-   **Course Creation:** Allows users to initiate the creation of a new course by providing an initial title, subject, and difficulty level.
-   **Course Detail View:** Shows comprehensive information about a specific course, including its AI-generated title, description, icon, subject, difficulty, status, and a list of its lessons (with their titles, descriptions, and statuses).
-   **Lesson Navigation:** (Implied) Users can likely navigate to view individual lesson content.

### Server-Side:
-   **REST API:** Exposes endpoints for managing courses and lessons.
    -   `POST /courses/`: Creates a new course using AI agents.
    -   `GET /courses/`: Retrieves all courses.
    -   `GET /courses/{course_id}`: Retrieves a specific course by its ID.
    -   `PATCH /courses/{course_id}`: Updates an existing course.
    -   `POST /lessons/{lesson_id}/regenerate`: Triggers the AI-powered regeneration of content for a specific lesson.
-   **AI-Powered Content Generation:**
    -   **Multi-Agent System:** Uses a two-step AI agent process for course creation:
        1.  **Planner Agent:** Takes the user's input (initial title, subject, difficulty) and designs the overall course structure. This includes generating a final course title, a compelling description, a relevant emoji icon, and an outline of 10-15 lessons with titles and brief descriptions. This agent is configured to output in JSON format.
        2.  **Lesson Content Agent:** For each lesson outlined by the Planner Agent, this agent generates the detailed lesson content in Markdown format. It can utilize external tools like YouTube search, web crawling (Crawl4AI), and Wikipedia to enrich the content.
    -   **LLM Flexibility:** The system can be configured to use different Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Anthropic's Claude or local models via Ollama (e.g., Gemma).
-   **Database:** Uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) to store course and lesson data.
-   **CORS Enabled:** Configured to allow requests from the Next.js frontend (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to streamline and automate the creation of online educational content. By leveraging AI, it aims to:
-   Reduce the time and effort required to develop a new course.
-   Provide a structured and comprehensive curriculum based on minimal user input.
-   Enable iterative refinement of content through lesson regeneration.
-   Offer a flexible platform that can be adapted to various subjects and educational needs.

This makes it an ideal tool for educators, content creators, or anyone looking to quickly generate initial drafts or complete versions of online courses.

## Getting Started

(Instructions for setting up and running the client and server would go here. This typically includes:
-   Cloning the repository.
-   Installing dependencies for both client (`yarn install` or `npm install`) and server (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
-   Setting up environment variables (e.g., API keys for LLMs, Supabase credentials, database URLs).
-   Running the development servers.)
